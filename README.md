# Phys346-Rutgers

Physics 346 Observational Astrophysics at Rutgers University

# Course Description

The Physics & Astronomy 346 course offers a panchromatic introduction to observational astrophysics i.e., spanning the radio, optical/infrared, and X-ray regimes. Students will gain experience working with data in at least two of these wavelength regimes, and with both imaging and spectroscopy. A significant goal of the course is to develop skills (including programming and data analysis) that are crucial for research and other STEM careers.
